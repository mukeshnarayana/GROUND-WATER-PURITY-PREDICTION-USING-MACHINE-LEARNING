# IDEA APPROACH
The proposed approach, however, is not constrained by the number of parameters or the selection of parameters. A k-fold cross validation technique is employed to set the learning and testing framework in this study, corresponding to each data sample in the data set. 

The dataset is separated into k-disjointed sets of equal size, each with roughly the same class distribution, using this technique. This division's subsets are utilised as the test set in turn, with the remaining subsets serving as the training set. 

These are Decision Tree (DT) and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) methods. In terms of the underlying relational structure between the indicator parameters and the class label, each of these strategies takes a different approach. As a result, each technique's performance for the same data set is likely to differ.

 Validating the performance of different classifiers on an unknown data set: Data mining provides several metrics for validating the performance of different classifiers on an unknown data set. 
A repeated cross-validation procedure in the Matlab caret package was used to create the learning and testing environment. The following procedure was used to apply the classification 

algorithm:
 1. The data set was split into two parts: training (80%) and testing (20%). (20 percent ). 
2. The training set was subjected to repeated cross-validation, with the number of iterations fixed to Classifiers were trained in this manner. 
3. The model's optimal parameter configuration was selected, resulting in the maximum accuracy. 4. The model was scrutinized
